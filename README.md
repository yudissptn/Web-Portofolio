# Web Portofolio
My web portofolio that shows all my coding practice, which is has an image linked to my project codepen address. In this portofolio, I add an animation CSS properties to show my work and Javascript to make this page more dynamic on certain position. This page using css @media to handle different device viewport, it will still arrange nicely while opened from mobile device.
